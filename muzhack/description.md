# Xth Sense

**Please note that this is an unofficial project page, the official one is

The Xth Sense‚Ñ¢ (2010-14) is a free and open biophysical technology. With it you can produce music
with the sound of your body. The Xth Sense captures sounds from heart, blood and muscles and
uses them to integrate the human body with a digital interactive system for sound and video
production. In 2012, it was named the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs most innovative new musical instrument‚Äù and
awarded the first prize in the Margaret Guthman New Musical Instrument Competition by the
Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology (US). Today, the Xth Sense is used by a steadily
growing community of creatives, ranging from performing artists and musicians, to researchers
in physiotherapy and prosthetics, and universities and students in diverse fields.

Check the video below to see what the Xth Sense can do!
And by the way, its name is spelled ecsth sense, not tenth sense‚Ä¶ üòõ

You can build an Xth Sense and learn how to use it either on your own by checking the
documentation here, or by taking part in one of the regular workshops taught wordlwide by
the Xth Sense, creator Marco Donnarumma. If you wish are an organisation and wish to host a
workshop, please get in touch.

The Xth Sense users forum lives at Createdigitalnoise/xth, and you can connect with us on
Facebook too.

The XS amplifies the muscle sounds of the human body, and use them as control data and
musical material.
When a performer contracts any muscle, low frequency sound are produced (technically called
mechanomyogram or MMG). By capturing these sounds with a microphone sensor embedded in the XS
armband, and live sampling them with a computer you get music in real time. It‚Äôs like connecting a
guitar to an effect pedal; in this case you connect your body to a computer. You have complete
control over the shape of the sounds by simply contracting your muscles in different ways.
For the tech-savy out there, more detailed information can be found in this list of publications.

The software driving the system is written in Pure Data aka Pd. It comes with a user-friendly
interface, features extraction, global preset saving, and many other features. The software can
be used as a stand-alone Pd patch, or it can communicate with other software, robot or light system
via the MIDI or OSC protocols. The code is open source (released under a GPL v3.0 license).

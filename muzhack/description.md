# Xth Sense

**Please note that this is an unofficial project page, the official one is

The Xth Sense‚Ñ¢ (2010-14) is a free and open biophysical technology. With it you can produce music
with the sound of your body. The Xth Sense captures sounds from heart, blood and muscles and
uses them to integrate the human body with a digital interactive system for sound and video
production. In 2012, it was named the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs most innovative new musical instrument‚Äù and
awarded the first prize in the
[Margaret Guthman New Musical Instrument Competition](http://www.guthman.gatech.edu/) by the
Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology (US). Today, the Xth Sense is used by a steadily
growing community of creatives, ranging from performing artists and musicians to researchers
in physiotherapy and prosthetics, as well as universities and students in diverse fields.

Check the video below to see what the Xth Sense can do! And by the way, its name is pronounced
ecsth sense, not tenth sense‚Ä¶ üòõ

You can build an Xth Sense and learn how to use it either on your own by checking the
documentation here, or by taking part in one of the [regular workshops](http://marcodonnarumma.com/teaching/xth-sense-biophysical-music/)
taught worldwide by the Xth Sense creator Marco Donnarumma. If you are an
organisation and wish to host a workshop, please [get in touch](mailto:m@marcodonnarumma.com).

The Xth Sense amplifies the muscle sounds of the human body, and uses them as control data and
musical material. When a performer contracts any muscle, low frequency sound is produced
(technically called [mechanomyogram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanomyogram) or MMG).
By capturing these sounds with a microphone sensor embedded in the XS armband, and live sampling
them with a computer you get music in real time. It‚Äôs like connecting a guitar to an effect pedal;
in this case you connect your body to a computer. You have complete control over the shape of the
sounds by simply contracting your muscles in different ways. For the tech-savvy out there, more
detailed information can be found in this
[list of publications](http://marcodonnarumma.com/texts/).

The software driving the system is written in [Pure Data AKA Pd](http://puredata.info/).
It comes with a user-friendly interface,
[features extraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction), global preset saving and
many other features. The software can be used as a stand-alone Pd patch or it can communicate
with other software, robot or light system via the MIDI or OSC protocols. The code is open
source (released under a [GPL v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license).

# Xth Sense Assembly Reference v2.0
**Please note that this is an unofficial project page, the official one is [here](http://res.marcodonnarumma.com/projects/xth-sense/).**

Time required: from 1 up to 4 hours (depending on your skills and practice).

1. Make sure you have all parts and components (see BOM), and the right tools.
You'll need: a soldering iron, solder, wire stripper, stranded wire, scissors and a 3V coin battery.
2. Cut the matrix board in order to comfortably fit the box, but bear in mind the board has to be
big enough to accommodate all the components.
3. Solder the circuit carefully following the schematics. You can solder everything except the
flexible audio cable. We'll do this later on. See the suggested layout below:

5. Using a suitable drill, make 2 holes in the plastic box. One hole is needed for the flexible
cable to reach the circuit inside the box; this can be done on the longer side of the box.
Another hole is needed to fit the jack socket, thus it has to be big enough and well centered on the side of the box; this can be done on the shorter side of the box. Always check the best location
for the holes and the jack socket by inserting the circuit inside the box *BEFORE* making the holes.
6. Cut a 1m long flexible cable (or longer, depending on which parts of the body you want to use).
7. Accommodate the flexible audio cable through the smaller hole on the box and solder the cable
voltage and ground wires to the circuit according to the schematics.

8. Now position the circuit inside the box and fix the jack socket into its hole.
Make sure you can close the box! Sometimes the jack socket might be slightly higher than the box.
If so, just cut away a small piece of the box cover so that you can close the box.

9. Prepare the velcro arm band. Cut two velcro strips (the one with the hooks and the one with the
loops) about 10/15cm long (this can be adjusted to the diameter you need). Sew them together,
but REMEMBER NOT TO SEW a small part (about 3/4 cm) of one of the sides of the arm band (at
about 1/4 of the whole length of the arm band), AND cut out a small corner at one end of the
arm band. You will need those holes to be able to embed the cable into the arm band.
10. When the arm band is ready, cut a small hole on its loop side; the position of the hole should
be at about 1/3 of the whole length of the arm band. We will use this hole to embed the microphone.

11. Take the free end of the audio cable, and insert it between the two sides of the velcro arm
band. Insert the cable from the corner of the arm band that has been cut (see picture above).
Let the audio cable come out of the hole you cut into the arm band.
12. Cut a small piece of the matrix board (like 4x3 holes). Solder the microphone onto its back
(i.e. the side without copper). Turn the small piece of board on the other side (with copper)
and solder the two wires of the audio cable to the microphone pins (don't mix up voltage and
ground!). See the microphone specification sheet (included in this package).

13. Isolate each wire (voltage and ground) separately, by applying black tape on the soldering iron.
14. Pull the audio cable delicately until the small piece of the board sits onto the velcro arm band.

15. You're almost done!! Place the silicone case on the microphone, make sure that the microphone
is as fixed as possible. The more the microphone is moving, the less accurate the signal is.
Be careful not to push the microphone too strongly. The hole in the silicone case is tight on
purpose and it might need a little bit of fiddling to fit. Once inside, it won't move any more.
IMPORTANT: it is crucial that the microphone is located at the bottom of the silicone case.
If the mic is too high it will touch your skin, and this is bad because the mic does not work with
skin contact. If the mic is too low inside the silicone case, the muscle sound will be very quiet.
16. Insert the battery into its battery holder, close the box. You're done, have fun!!

# Xth Sense Assembly Reference v2.0
**Please note that this is an unofficial project page, the official one is [here](http://res.marcodonnarumma.com/projects/xth-sense/).**

**Thanks for choosing our kits!**
This manual is written with the problems that we usually find in our workshops in mind.
Also the order is meant to make assembly as easy as possible. Some steps are not obvious so even
if you're an experienced DIYer, read the steps completely before taking them.

If this is your first project, please read this article before you start assembling the kit:

**May the luck be with you!**

## Main PCB (the small one)
**Open Main Board Bag A**

### Resistors
Solder the resistors.

### Diodes
Solder the diodes **respecting the polarity**. A black or white line on the diode must be in the same
place as the white line on the diode symbol on the PCB silkscreen.

### Ferrite
Solder the two ferrite beads passing trough a recycled resistor leg and proceed as if it were a
resistor. Ferrite beads don't have polarity.

The space for ferrites is a bit tight. Leave them a bit separated from the board to make them fit
between the power connector and the diodes.

**Open Main Board Bag B**

### ICs
**Place the IC sockets** taking care of their orientation and solder them on IC1, IC2 and IC3. The
orientation must match the PCB's outline.

Place the three ICs on the sockets taking care of polarity. The mark on the front of the IC must
match the mark on the socket and the PCB's silkscreen.

### Capacitors
Solder the capacitors.

### Electrolytic Capacitors
Values written at the side of the capacitor. Mind polarity. Check the positive terminal on board and
make it match with the long leg.

### Transistors
Make sure they are positioned correctly with reference to the silkscreen outline on the PCB.

### Male Pin Headers
Place and solder the two male pin headers on the silkscreen side, ensuring they are 90ยบ to the PCB.
The shortest side of the pins is for soldering.

### Power Connector
Solder the power connector ensuring the position is correct: it must be on the silkscreen side
with the pins facing out.

## Control PCB
**Open Control Board Bag A**

### Resistors
Solder resistors.

### Diodes
Solder diodes observing polarity. The black line on the diode must be in the same
place as the white line on the diode PCB silkscreen.

### Capacitors
Solder capacitors.

### Electrolytic Capacitors
Values written on the side of the capacitors. Mind polarity. Check positive terminal on board and
make it match with the long leg.

### Female Pin Headers
Place the two female pin headers on the silkscreen side and solder them ensuring they are 90ยบ to
the PCB.

**Open Control Board Bag B**

### Spacers
Place the four spacers on the holes using the male side and facing the resistor's side of the PCB.
Then fix with the two 3mm nuts.

### Front panel components mounting tips
Now we will proceed to mount jacks, potentiometers, switches and LEDs. This part of assembly is
CRITICAL. Please be gentle and read the instructions carefully. These components must NEVER
be soldered until they are placed and/or totally screwed to the front panel.

This is so for reasons:

* The height of panel components is not exactly the same. Because of this, if not screwed properly
before soldering, they will not stay properly seated to the panel. This might cause mechanical
torsions, reducing their life expectancy and in worst cases they will break.
* The second reason is that it is very difficult to hit the holes if panel is not positioned before
soldering. In LEDs case they are almost impossible to place to the exact height without reference
of the front panel.

**Open mini-jacks bag**

## Minijacks
Place the minijacks ensuring they are on the silkscreen side but **don't solder them** until the
front panel is in place and with all nuts screwed to it. This way it's easier to solder them in
the right position. Keep in mind that the front panel holes are quite narrow and it is
almost impossible to place it with all the components already soldered. Caution: the switch
nuts and the jack nuts look alike but they are not and will not fit in each other's threads so
don't mix them!

## Potentiometers
Cut the little edge on all four pots with cutting pliers as pictured:

![Potentiometer](http://aknuds1.github.io/befaco-spring-reverb/pictures/potmeter.png "Potentiometer")

Now place the potentiometers on the PCB but... **don't solder them**

## Switch
Place the toggle switch, but **don't solder it** until it's screwed to the front panel. This way
it's easier to solder it in the right position.

## Jack
Place the Jack connector on the top side of the silkscreen, taking care to put it in the right
position (the shape must match the drawing on the PCB) but don't solder it until it is screwed
to the front panel.

## LEDs
Put the LEDs in place checking the polarity, but **don't solder them** until the front panel is
in place. This is the only way to solder them in the right position.

The long leg is the + and the short one is the minus. There is a + symbol on the PCB to indicate the
correct position.

## FRONT PANEL
**Place the front panel** moving a little the parts one by one if necessary until you fit them
to the top. At this point a pair of sharp tweezers can be helpful.

Screw in the next order: Minijacks, switch, pots and jack.

Until all of them are flat and touching completely the panel.
**Then (finally) solder all of them.** ; )

**Place the LEDs** in the panel holes making sure they are on the right level and proceed to
solder them.

**Plug the PCB1 onto the PCB2** using the pin headers and ensuring the two 3mm holes match
the spacers. Screw both boards using two screws.

**Put the knobs** on the potentiometers and the caps on the switches/faders.

**Plug in the power ribbon cable**: The blue wire (negative) corresponds to pin number one
of the connector. Pin number one is indicated with a small triangle and usually with a line on
your power bus.

**Enjoy!**
